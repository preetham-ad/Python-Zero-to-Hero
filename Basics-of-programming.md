# Computer Basics

## 1. What's a Computer?
A computer is a machine that takes instructions, processes information, and helps us perform tasks, like doing calculations, browsing the internet, or writing documents.

### Example of How a Computer Works:
1. **You input instructions:** Type 5 and 3, and click "Add."
2. **Computer processes:** The processor adds the numbers.
3. **Computer provides output:** The result (8) is shown to you.

This basic process is the same for more complex tasks: the computer takes instructions, processes data according to those instructions, and then provides the result.

## 2. Processor (CPU)
The processor, or Central Processing Unit (CPU), is like the brain of the computer. It executes instructions from programs and makes decisions based on those instructions. It handles tasks like calculations and controlling other parts of the computer.

### Example: Calculating the Average of Two Numbers
1. **You provide instructions:** Write a program or use a calculator to find the average of 10 and 20.
2. **CPU processes:**
   - Fetches instructions from memory.
   - Decodes the instructions to understand the task.
   - Executes the calculations (addition and division).
   - Stores the result and outputs it to the display.
3. **Result:** The average (15) is shown to you.

This example illustrates how the CPU is involved in executing a program’s instructions, performing calculations, and providing the final output.

## 3. Programming and Code
Programming is the process of creating instructions for the computer to follow. These instructions are written in a language that the computer can understand, which is called code. Just like a recipe guides you to cook a meal, code guides the computer to perform tasks.

## 4. Software (S/W)
Software is a collection of programs and apps that tells a computer what to do.

Think of it like the set of instructions or tools that let the computer perform tasks, like playing games, browsing the web, or writing documents.

## 5. Encoding
Encoding is the process of converting data into a different format for efficient storage or transmission. For example, text encoding converts characters into binary code that a computer can process.

## 6. Memory
Memory in a computer is where data and instructions are stored. It’s like a workspace where the computer keeps information it needs to work with.

## 7. Processor Memory Hierarchy
- **Registers:** These are the fastest and smallest type of memory located inside the CPU. They hold data that the CPU is currently processing.
- **Cache:** Cache memory is slightly larger than registers but still very fast. It stores frequently used data and instructions to speed up processing.
- **Main Memory (RAM):** This is where the computer stores data and programs that are currently in use. It’s larger than cache but slower.
- **Secondary Memory (Hard Drive/SSD):** This is where data is stored long-term, such as files and applications. It’s the largest form of memory but also the slowest.

## 8. MIPS
MIPS stands for "Million Instructions Per Second." It’s a measure of how many instructions a CPU can execute in one second. It gives an idea of the CPU's performance.
